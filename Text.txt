The key={index} prop is used for React's list rendering optimization.
React needs a way to uniquely identify each element. The key prop helps React:
1.Track which items have changed, been added, or removed
2.Preserve component state - Without keys, React might accidentally reuse the wrong component instances
3.Improve performance - Keys help React minimize unnecessary re-renders

Backend/UserModel............................

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ : Create a new schema blueprint that defines the structure and rules for 
user documentation.

const UserModel = mongoose.model.user || mongoose.model("user", userSchema); : Creates or retrieves the "user" model. It first checks if mongoose.model.user exists; if not, it creates a new model named "user" with the defined schema. This prevents model redefinition errors
